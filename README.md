To address the lack of an Intelligent Sustainability Score, the GreenIQ application proposes a data-driven sustainability assessment system that evaluates polymers beyond biodegradability. The system will compute a comprehensive Sustainability Score by integrating key environmental factors such as toxicity, recyclability, and biodegradation efficiency.
Using machine learning and advanced analytics, the system will:
•	Sustainability Score: Calculate the score by analysing polymer properties.
•	AI-Based Analysis: Utilize machine learning for accurate scoring.
•	Polymer Comparison: Evaluates and ranks materials by impact.
•	Alternative Suggestions: Recommends eco-friendly options.
